Skills and Qualifications:  This position requires a strong math background, with a particular focus on machine learning algorithms and comfort with quantitative analysis.  You should be quite familiar with leading practices in the machine learning lifecycle, including data preparation for analysis, ML model selection, training and validation. We also expect that you have experience with preparing ML models for production.  We expect you to be a strong programmer, and willing to embrace software engineering best practices. We primarily work in Python for research code but are always open to the best technologies for a given problem.  You should also have a background in current CI/CD and DevOps practices. Working knowledge of the Kubernetes ecosystem and production-grade ML systems is a plus.  You should be comfortable to diving into diverse forms of data in order to help define questions that can and should be answered  We often find in applied machine learning that the art of asking the right question is more of a challenge than finding the answer. We expect you’ll be enthusiastic and skilled at formulating the right questions and thinking strategically. Sometimes the simplest solution is the best answer.  You should have spent at least 3 years as a practicing data scientist or machine learning engineer.  In your past, you should have completed a degree program in a computationally intensive quantitative field (e.g. CS, physics, neuroscience, operations management, operations research) or demonstrated relevant experience in using data science and machine learning to solve business problems.

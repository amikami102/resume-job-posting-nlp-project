The professionals at NSA have one common goal: to protect our nation. The mission requires a strong offense and a steadfast defense. The offense collects, processes, and disseminates intelligence information derived from foreign signals for intelligence and counterintelligence purposes. The defense prevents adversaries from gaining access to sensitive classified national security information. NSA is the nation's leader in providing foreign signals intelligence while also protecting U.S. government information systems, forging the frontier of communications and analysis. We serve the American people by applying a wide variety of technical skills to produce meaningful results that help protect our nation, keeping our friends and families safe for generations to come. NSA's Linguists, known as Multidisciplined Language Analysts (MDLAs), are expected to take an inclusive approach to problem solving and mission accomplishment by frequently engaging with partners, enablers, and customers across the Intelligence Community.\nDescription of Position\nNSA MDLAs are hired into the Language Analysis Development Program (LADP) or, in the case of MDLAs with extensive experience in Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), directly into positions supporting an analytic mission office.\nThe LADP, which lasts up to three years, is designed to provide an intensive, accelerated opportunity to acquire the unique technical skills and experience needed to successfully apply knowledge and analytic ability to the SIGINT mission and help MDLAs achieve core analytic competencies in accordance with the Cryptologic Training System Training Standard and the MDLA competencies framework. The program includes 4-5 operational tours in a variety of offices, interspersed with formal classroom and computer-based training. These on-the-job operational tours are primarily focused on analyzing foreign language materials within the framework of the two main SIGINT disciplines of intelligence analysis - SIGINT reporting and SIGINT development.\nMultidisciplined Language Analysts are at the forefront of carrying out NSA's SIGINT mission, and they do so in a variety of ways. MDLAs:\n- Offer U.S. policymakers and military leaders a window into the foreign language world of intelligence targets by analyzing, transcribing, and translating key information\n- Research and understand foreign intelligence targets, how they operate, and how they fit in the larger geo-political context\n- Apply new techniques and develop creative solutions to address analytic problems such as synthesizing large volumes of data and disparate sources of information\n- Demonstrate a firm understanding of the communications environment and technology trends of foreign intelligence targets\n- Craft written and oral assessments of foreign intelligence that provide unique insights into target intentions unavailable from other intelligence disciplines\n- Work independently and collaborate effectively (both within NSA and with other analysts in the Intelligence Community) in research, analysis, and reporting"", '\nSkills', '\nThe ideal candidate is intellectually curious, has a desire for continual learning, and is:\n- Proficient (reading and listening) in one or more critical foreign languages, including Russian, Chinese, Arabic, Somali, Persian Farsi, Korean, Turkish and other languages as missions and needs evolve\n- Well organized and able to handle multiple assignments\n- A strong written and oral communicator\n- Able to synthesize information to solve complex problems\n- Able to provide timely and accurate customer service\nCoursework, knowledge, and experience in one or more of the following is desired:\n- Target development\n- Social network analysis\n- Metadata analysis\n- Research methodology\n- Topical or Regional studies relevant to national security\n- Quantitative/Statistical analysis\n- Data modeling, mining, or science\n- Cyber security\n- Computer science or networking\n- Telecommunications\nRelevant Internships, extracurricular activities, and/or foreign study are also considered.\nPrior military without a degree but with language analysis cryptologic experience will be considered.\nIn most cases, Experienced Level Language Analysts at NSA will have substantial experience in one or more of the following areas:\n- Performing language quality control;\n- Serving as an established Subject Matter Expert (SME);\n- Authoring and releasing reports;\n- Mentoring, coaching, and leading other Language Analysts;\n- Ensuring the technical health of the mission;\n- Mastering and coaching others on the use of a variety of internal tools;\n- Testing at Interagency Language Roundtable (ILR) 3/3 levels for one or more mission languages; and\n- Displaying a broad knowledge of the Intelligence Community and how various elements work together to prosecute mission.', '\nPay, Benefits, & Work Schedule', '\nOn-the-job training, Internal NSA courses, and external training will be made available based on the need and experience of the selectee.\nMonday - Friday, with basic 8hr/day work requirements between 0600 and 1800 (flexible).\nNSA hires for a variety of locations, to include: Maryland, Georgia, Hawaii, Texas, Utah, and other locations.', '\nPosition Summary', '\nAs a language analyst, you will use your passion for foreign language and strong oral communication, written communication, and critical thinking skills to research, translate, transcribe, report, and analyze foreign intelligence. Your foreign language and English skills will provide key decision makers with a complete and accurate picture of the context within which the decision is being made (i.e. provide an understanding of the nuance, context, cultural overtones, and dialect in which the communication occurred). Another way to use your foreign language skills at NSA is to work as a scientific linguist. Scientific linguists support the mission by designing, developing, evaluating, and/or integrating products to enhance the understanding of mission critical foreign languages or materials by applying linguistic knowledge (e.g. syntax, morphology, phonetics, semantics) to address operational problems.', '\nQualifications', ""\nSalary Range: $48,583 - $74,759 (Entry/Developmental)\n*The qualifications listed are the minimum acceptable to be considered for the position.
